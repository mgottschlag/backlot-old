	 * read/write operations start at the current read/write position which
	 * is 0 if the buffer has just been created. If multiple bytes are written
	 * or read, they are converted to/from network byte order if necessary. The
	 * buffer uses bit-packing, so integers with arbitrary size can be written
	 * and read without wasting any space. Note that reads/writes at byte
	 * boundaries are faster than reads/writes starting in the middle of a byte.
	 * nextByte() can be used to align the current position in order to
	 * minimize CPU usage, although this usually comes with a larger buffer
	 * size.
